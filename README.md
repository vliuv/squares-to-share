# squares-to-share
A collaborative art project where anyone can create and share their own square of art to be a part of a digital blanket inspired by Afghan blankets and granny squares. You can browse and like other users' squares or create and upload your own directly on the website.

An admin feature allows users with the login information to oversee and delete any posts.
